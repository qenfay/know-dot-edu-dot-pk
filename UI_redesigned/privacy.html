					<h2>Your Privacy</h2>
					<p style="font-size: large;">
						At <b>Know.edu</b>, we greatly value the privacy of our customer, be they students or teachers. No staff from Know will <u style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">ever</u> ask for
						your password, so do not, at any cost, give away your password. <br><br><b>What are we doing with your information?</b><br>
						Your information is used in Analytics to decide which courses are more popular, and if you are a teacher, we display <b>some</b> of your information
						on course pages so that a student may know your credentials. For both students and teachers, we use their credentials for both analytics and other purposes. Other than that, 
						your information is generally kept safe, and our admins are not allowed to make any alterations <b>without your consent</b>. However, in some cases, for example, to update a teacher's
						contact information, we may alter your information, but this is generally done only in <u style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">cases of emergency.</u>
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">
						<b>Are you sharing my information with other organisations?</b><br>
						We only share your information with select organisations, all of them being accredited and top universities that are collaborating with us. This is done for two reasons; <b>one</b>, to allow 
						our students to get their courses accredited and accepted by the universities, so that their credits may be added, and <b>two</b>, to recruit teachers from our partnered universities to teach our courses.
						In either case, you may be rest assured that we are not sharing your information with any organisations except well-known and reputable universities, albeit if you wish, it can be shared with accreditation authorities as well, 
						such as the HEC.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">
						<b>Are you sharing my information with any social media?</b><br>
						The short answer is <b>no.</b> While we do have official social media accounts, they are primarily for advertising (and in the case of YouTube, to upload free previews and lectures), 
						but none of your personal or account information is shared with any of them.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">
						<b>How long is my information being kept?</b><br>
						Your account information is kept with us as long as you have your account, until or unless you delete your account, or if you are permanently banned from the website for violating our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, in which case 
						only your IP Address is stored (the rest of your information is made anonymous) in order to keep the ban intact. Your other information, such as cookies and browser information to give you the appropriate suggestions, is kept as long as you maintain activity on our website 
						or as long as it is relevant following the trends of your activity on the website. This is done to tailor and suggest courses and lecturers according to your needs.
