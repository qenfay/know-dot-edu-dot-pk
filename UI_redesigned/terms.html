                        and as such, as long as Know.edu deems it necessary, courses shall <i>not</i> be distributable outside of the website, <b>except</b> in the case of our own social media accounts such as YouTube, where only 
                        a select amount of content will be made available.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        No teacher may use the content they have in an illegitimate fashion, or provide course materials <u>explicit to the website</u> to any people outside of the website, unless they are their personal resources. Any and all 
                        resources provided to the teachers or lecturers by the website fall under the copyright, as well as the courses which they teach on the website. According to their contract, they may not make the same courses available to anyone 
                        for free or otherwise in an illegitimate fashion, unless the course they teach belongs to another platform. If this is not the case, the course may not be made available to any student who has not enrolled in the course officially.

                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        Entire majors belonging to universities or offered by universities are also included in this, as it is by their consent that said majors are available on Know.edu. Therefore violation of their copyright may result in strict legal action 
                        from the universities themselves. In such a case, Know will not in any way intervene or contest their decision to pursue legal action.

                    <h2>Account Terms of Use</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        According to your account contract (be it a student or teacher account), you are required to follow our Terms of Service, as in a specific set of rules. These are divided into two categories; <b>forum rules</b> and 
                        <b>user terms.</b> As far as forum rules are concerned, they are the following:<br><br> 
                        - Racism or sexism in any form, NSFW material, personal information of yours or others, direct insults, and spam, will not be tolerated.<br>
                        - Sharing of any underaged content, including animated lolita or cub content, is not allowed.<br>
                        - Bullying, harrassment and repeated insults of a personal nature may result in a temporary or even permanent ban.<br>
                        - You are requested to respect race/ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, religion, political beliefs, age, and other attributes/beliefs that people get bullied for.<br>
                        - Hate speech against a certain group, including blasphemy of <i>any</i> nature will not be tolerated.<br><br>
                        These are some of the user terms, the full terms can be found in an email when you sign up:<br><br>
                        - You may not share the content of this website on other sources.<br>
                        - Teachers may not give a student resources that other students are not given.<br>
                        - Do not harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail addresses and pictures without their consent.<br>

                        - Doing anything in violation of the copyright is prohibited.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Disciplinary Actions</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        Disciplinary action will vary according to the severity of the breach of rules. It may range from an account suspension to a permanent IP ban, or a simple warning in less severe cases. 
                        The number of offences the user has committed prior will also be considered in a "strike system" where:<br><br>
                        <b>Offence Severity 1:</b> May be a simple warning or a very short suspension.<br>
                        <b>Offence Severity 2:</b> Generally a longer, but still temporary suspension of the account.<br>
                        <b>Offence Severity 3:</b> A permanent IP ban, which may be appealed after a minimum of 90 days. In some cases, there will be no appeal.
